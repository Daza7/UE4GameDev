 top down style steampunk puzzle loosely put.
The idea is the character has 3 different types of "lemmings" or bots to help them through the level and they have to make them count, without using them properly they cannot complete the level.
the idea is they have to go through this steampunk world and turn on multiple switches
to start a counter on a machine.
the 3 different types of lemmings can be used to help you throughout the level essentially, so far marcel has suggested we have oil, electricity and gas.
however this isn't set in stone
we think we're going to limit the lemmings count to two per type
so you have 2 oil, electricity and gas types and you have to use them to progress through the level and activate the things needed to start the clock.
